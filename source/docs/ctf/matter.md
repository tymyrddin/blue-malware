# THM Dunkle Materie

The firewall alerted the Security Operations Center that one of the machines at the Sales department, which stores 
all the customers' data, contacted the malicious domains over the network. When the Security Analysts looked closely, 
the data sent to the domains contained suspicious base64-encoded strings. The Analysts involved the Incident Response 
team in pulling the Process Monitor and network traffic data to determine if the host is infected. But once they got 
on the machine, they knew it was a ransomware attack by looking at the wallpaper and reading the ransomware note.

Find more evidence of compromise on the host and what ransomware was involved in the attack.
